##Cornucopia Icon Set, v1.0


This icon set is licensed under the GNU General Public license, version 3, a copy of which is provided with the set. 

This icon set is a COMPILATION of Ubuntu icons from various sources, primarily the FS Icon set by Frank Souza. This project's aim is to be a common and compatible icon set for both *Ubuntu* and *Fedora* (so for both GNOME3 and Unity). I'll add other distros if possible. 

Links to the original icon set can be found [here](http://franksouza183.deviantart.com/art/FS-Icons-Ubuntu-288407674) and [here](http://franksouza183.deviantart.com/art/FS-Icons-288489126). The above icon sets were also hosted on [Gnome Look](gnome-look.org).

If you find that there are icons missing or any other problems, please raise an issue [here](https://github.com/Rohan62442/Cornucopia/issues). For instructions, check the [wiki](https://github.com/Rohan62442/Cornucopia/wiki).
